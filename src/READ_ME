Xjig was written by Jeff Steidl and Vivekananda Maganty.

To compile xjig:
   1) Change the first -D (define) for the CFLAGS to be the
      desired architecture.  Xjig knows about the following
      architectures:
         SunOS
         DEC
         HPUX
      The only difference in compilation for the different
      architectures is the location of .h files and the
      need (or lack thereof) to predeclare library functions.
      If you wish to compile xjig for a different system,
      you will probably need to modify the file "system.h".
      (Note:  xjig has not actually been tested on HPUX yet.
       Last time it was checked, it did not work.  However,
       a bug-fix was introduced to get the DEC version working
       which may have also fixed the HPUX problem.)
   2) Use make.
