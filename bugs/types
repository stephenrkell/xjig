This file describes the types of testing used to obtain crashes/hangs
for several X-Window applications.

The types of testing used are:

1. Random messages
2. Mangling/Garbling of messages
3. Random Events
4. Legal Events

 - commas seperate seperate crashes or hangs

 - adjacent numbers represent multiple techniques to achieve a single
   crash or hang

 - a preceding X means that it was aimed at the X server (all others
   were aimed at the client, note that a preceding X applies only
   to the digit immediately following it)
